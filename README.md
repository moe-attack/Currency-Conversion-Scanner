## About
This app was created to as a side project to demonstrate my understanding to iOS development.
MVC design pattern was used to separate the concerns of different application logics, and Object Oriented Principles SOLID was followed.
The app uses latest core technology frameworks from Apple, such as:
- Vision framework, for text detection and analysis; 
- CoreData, for creating persistent database storage;
- CoreLocation, to analyze device location
- AVFoundation, to access the video capturing device and process the output
